## Process

We donâ€™t have answers sitting on the shelf. Creating something out of nothing is not what we do. Through constant questioning, deep exploration and contemplation of our current experience we arrive at a comprehensive understanding of the project objectives. We then develop an experience which will turn a few heads but ultimately service the need of your organization beyond the expected.

### Start at the beginning

When we set out to create we often start with a conversation. We try to establish a deeper understanding. Understanding may seem simple but it becomes increasingly complex as more people become involved. As one forms their own perceptions or judgement, it can affect the overall group's understanding or judgement. For many moons, the creative brief has tried to solve the problem. It's a document often used as the Ten Commandments for creative projects. Often written by the client and given to the creative agency it's purpose is to inform the agency of the project's intent and purpose.  Though the document attempts to create a mutual understanding it's often frought with issues surrounding the organizations strategic direction, lacks context, and is authored by the party not inclined to fully comprehend the process and procedures in creating the deliverables which they likely have never created before. It would be analogous to writing a paper on how to build a house with zero knowledge of construction, the building industry, or architecture. Sure you might be able to describe wide concepts, such as desiring a house with 3 bedrooms, 2 baths, a modern kitchen, two car garage and Arts and Craft finishes. Even if this brief was 100 pages in length it would not develop as strong of a mutual understanding as one hour long conversation could yield. The reason for this is simple, the creative brief is a one way street. It doesn't allow for constructive conversation, questions and answers, disagreement and resolution. Though the brief was likely slaved over by someone responsible for the project it is equally as likely not reviewed by all affected by the project. If we consider our example of the brief for building a house, imagine the document was written by the wife, and reviewed by the husband. Imagine all of the differences of opinion and termoil that would likely exist on something as simple as "Arts and Craft Finishes". Accepting a project on what has been laid out in a brief is no way to start what should be painless process. In contrast to this approach at Simple.Honest.Work. we start by gathering all stakeholders for an entire day event that helps establish the firm foundation of mutual understanding. An understanding between all the stakeholders and Simple.Honest.Work. This is the beginning of our Understand phase.
